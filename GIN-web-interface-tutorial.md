# GIN Web Interface Tutorial

[GIN (G-Node Infrastructure)](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki) is a free and open neuroscientific data management system developed by the [German Neuroinformatics Node (G-Node)](https://www.g-node.org/). It offers a public service in the form of [research data repository](https://gin.g-node.org/) that can be used to share your own research data with collaborators and/or share it with the scientific community during research output publication. GIN can also be installed locally ([in-house-GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/In+House)) on a personal computer or on a local university server accessible via your institution's intranet or even made accessible publicly via an internet domain name.

The latter set up is appealing to us because it gives us:
- an extra layer of data security which is important when dealing with sensitive data;
- a potential to develop our GIN-based data sharing platform in a way that is uniquely suited to our own needs;
- a drive for increasing data sharing and collaboration within neuroscience research groups at the University of Bristol;
- a nudge for data standardisation.

There is a number of benefits of using GIN in addition to a traditional way of managing your research data using a file manager software:
