# GIN Web Interface Tutorial

The aim of this tutorial is to give you an introduction to using the GIN web interface. For this tutorial you will need a laptop with an internet connection and [a mock repository](TeamNeuroUoB) downloaded on your computer.

In this tutorial you will learn how to:
1. Create a repository
2. Upload files to a repository
3. Download files from a repository onto your computer
4. Transfer repository ownership to your organisation
5. Create a collaborating team
6. Assign the repository to the team
7. Add members to the team

UoB GIN is currently available only on the UoB intranet. Therefore, we are going to use [the web GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/) instead. This is fine as the two work the same. We start by registering an account with the web GIN. You just need to follow the instructions on the screen and your account is set up. Once the registration is done, you should have an account open as shown in the figure below.
