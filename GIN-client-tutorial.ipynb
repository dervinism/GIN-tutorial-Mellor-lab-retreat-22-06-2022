    "In this notebook I give an example of how you can manage your GIN repository using command line tools. First step is to download and [install the GIN client](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Setup) on your computer. GIN client can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux machines. Once the GIN client is installed, register your account with [the web GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/user/sign_up). Registration is easy and when it is done, you can login to your GIN account via the command line (just specify your own username):"
